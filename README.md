# DropChain POAP App

Welcome! This is the open-sourced example of how to build a blockchain POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) styled blockchain app with the DropChain Javascript SDK.

### Quickstart
To start using the DropChain SDK, simply run:

``` npm install dropchain-sdk ```

For this example, we have the required packages installed already. However, you can install all of the packages you need to replicate this environment with:

```npm install express dropchain-sdk dotenv cors body-parser```

### Examples
The most important pieces to the app example are within the /pages/ section (frontend) to see the formatting of the payload for the DropChain SDK, and in the /backend/server.js section (how we use the DropChain SDK to handle requests and make transactions to the blockchain.

See ```/backend/server.js``` for code snippet examples of how to start using the DropChain SDK.
